# buidl-your-own-wallet

A compilation of scripts to perform basic Web3 wallet management functions within a single interface. Create a wallet, check its balance, submit transactions, estimate gas costs, encrypt your private key to JSON keystore, and decrypt your JSON keystore to private key. Here are some quick demo walkthroughs of some of the core functionalities:

>THIS WALLET DOES NOT COME WITH ROBUST SECURITY FEATURES AND USING IT OUTSIDE A TESTING OR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED. BY USING THIS WALLET YOU AGREE IT IS PROVIDED TO YOU WITHOUT WARRANTY AND IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, ARISING FROM YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH IT


## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Web3.js (installed automatically during initial setup)](https://github.com/web3/web3.js)
3. [Dotenv (installed automatically during initial setup)](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

## Initial setup

Clone this repo to a preferred location and install all dependencies by entering the following in CLI from your project's `root` folder:

```shell
// CLI
npm install
```

To use the functions within this script you will need a node `endpoint`. Get one for free via the [Chainstack console](https://console.chainstack.com/).

## Usage

### 1. Create a `.env` file and enter your endpoint URL with the following format:

```shell
// .env
ENDPOINT="yOuR_eNdPoInT_URL_hErE"
```

### 2. Run the `index.js` script from your CLI and use the UI to perform the functions you need:

```shell
// CLI
node index
```

or alternatively via `npm`:

```shell
// CLI
npm run start
```

### 3. Create a new wallet by pressing the `Create wallet` button. You can also download the output as a JSON file.

```js
// UI returns
# {
#   "address": '0xYoUrPuBlIcKeYhErE',
#   "privateKey": '0xYoUrPrIvAtEkEyHeRe',
# }
```

The script will also add the private key of your newly create wallet to the `.env` file automatically:

```shell
// .env file changes
ENDPOINT="yOuR_eNdPoInT_URL_hErE"
PRIVATE_KEY="0xYoUrPrIvAtEkEyHeRe"
PRIVATE_KEY_PASS="undefined"
```

Note that unless you have set up a PRIVATE_KEY_PASS key and value in your `.env` file the script will automatically add a line about it with `undefined` as value.

### 4. Check the balance of your wallet by clicking on the `Check balance` button. You can also download the output as a JSON file.

```js
// UI returns
# {
#   "address":"0xYoUrPuBlIcKeYhErE",
#   "weiBalance":"1337000000000000000"
#   "gweiBalance":"1337000000"
#   "ethersBalance":"1.337"
# }
```
### 5. Open your `.env` file and add a `PRIVATE_KEY_PASS` key if you don't have one already and set a preferred password for your encrypted `JSON` file:

```shell
// .env
ENDPOINT="yOuR_eNdPoInT_URL_hErE"
PRIVATE_KEY="0xYoUrPrIvAtEkEyHeRe"
PRIVATE_KEY_PASS="yOuRpAsSwOrDhErE"
```

### 6. Encrypt your private key to file with the `Encrypt private key to JSON keystore` button. You can also download the output as a JSON file.


// UI returns
```js
# {
#  "version": 3,
#  "id": 'ace5ff1c-c971-4b8c-b066-e6215f7420d9',
#  "address": '224a67b1e8a6b6b0ccb5deec44919ad983c82b12',
#  "crypto": {
#    "ciphertext": '423964514ee7eb5ee8f7c4047836e5743d12715889787325cc65b26b2d42ab7c',
#    "cipherparams": { "iv": 'b7b16712524da59ca7585bcd55263f4b' },
#    "cipher": 'aes-128-ctr',
#    "kdf": 'scrypt',
#    "kdfparams": {
#      "dklen": 32,
#      "salt": 'f99a05124ac9459d7fb045371bf975671e06f0125470c94990995e6e0a981312',
#      "n": 8192,
#      "r": 8,
#      "p": 1
#    },
#    mac: '888d45374904d553ce9ee60ee49a2c52829159322a36961e2bd5efb28dba58c3'
#  }
# }
```

This will be reflected in the generated `/dls/encryptedKeyStore.json` file

```js
// /dls/encryptedKeyStore.json file output
{"version":3,"id":"5b90f2fd-4eee-4979-a63d-82421f00ce3c","address":"a3d13afd97d3327e29178dbd8a1bc3fc639f363b","crypto":{"ciphertext":"1b69bc20f3b55ff3b4c32ebc0825c3c2d33daf1b1c080219db05fae9d806a0e6","cipherparams":{"iv":"773dd2ad24f0fb8973dd73184f0bf2b3"},"cipher":"aes-128-ctr","kdf":"scrypt","kdfparams":{"dklen":32,"salt":"5b49ecae1740ceef08686468a6179c1d154d7fea1997e1bada81050096cb042a","n":8192,"r":8,"p":1},"mac":"8a6f36122eec78348be94fa1352ecf28be0f875b92d64924e3708b34f2440114"}}
```

### 7. Decrypt your JSON keystore file with the `Decrypt JSON keystore to private key` button. You can also download the output as a JSON file.

```js
// CLI script returns
# {
#   "address": '0xYoUrPuBlIcKeYhErE',
#   "privateKey": '0xYoUrPrIvAtEkEyHeRe',
# }
```

This will be reflected in the generated `/dls/decryptedKeyStore.json` file

```shell
// /dls/decryptedKeyStore.json file output
{"address":"0xYoUrPuBlIcKeYhErE","privateKey":"0xYoUrPrIvAtEkEyHeRe"}
```

### 8. Load an externally-created wallet via private key import with the `Add private key` button. You can also download the output as a JSON file.

```js
// UI returns
# {
#   "address": "0xYoUrPuBlIcKeYhErE",
#   "privateKey": "0xYoUrPrIvAtEkEyHeRe",
# }
```

The script will also add the private key of your newly create wallet to the `.env` file automatically:

```shell
// .env file changes
ENDPOINT="yOuR_eNdPoInT_URL_hErE"
PRIVATE_KEY="0xYoUrPrIvAtEkEyHeRe"
PRIVATE_KEY_PASS="undefined"
```

### 9. Estimate the gas costs of a transaction from the currently loaded to a receiving wallet of your choice with the `Estimate gas costs` button. You can also download the output as a JSON file.

```js
// UI returns
# { "sender":"0xYoUrPuBlIcKeYhErE",
#   "receiver":"0xReCeIvErPuBlIcKeYhErE",
#   "estimate":21000
# }
```

### 10. Send a transaction with specific `from`, `to`, `value`, and `data` parameters, then get the hash as receipt with the `Send transaction` button. You can also download the receipt output as a JSON file.

```js
// UI returns
# {
#   "from":"0xYoUrPuBlIcKeYhErE",
#   "to":"0xReCeIvErPuBlIcKeYhErE",
#   "value":"1337",
#   "data":"0x80085",
#   "gas":"22222",
#   "hash":"0xYoUrTxReCeIpThAsHhErE"
# }
```
